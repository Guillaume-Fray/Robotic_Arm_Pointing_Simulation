# Robotic_Arm_Pointing_Simulation (C++)
Train a robotic arm to point towards an object using Inverse Kinematics.

Tools:
  . OpenGL library (and libQGLViewer)
  . Eigen Library
  . BOOST library

The project includes:
  . Building a 3D simulation that matches the robotic arm model (dimensions, degrees of freedom, features...etc)  using the OpenGL C++ library.
  . Implementing motion rate control to solve the inverse kinematics problem. (Denavit-Hartenberg matrix, FW, Jacobian matrix...)
